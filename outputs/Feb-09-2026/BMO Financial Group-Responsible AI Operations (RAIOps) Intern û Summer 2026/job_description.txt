This RAIOps role supports the AI Center of Excellence in implementing Responsible AI practices across Wealth AI and enterprise AI initiatives. You will contribute to governance, monitoring, compliance, and model oversight activities that help ensure AI is safe, fair, transparent, and reliable.

Key Accountabilities

• Develop Python code using AI governance libraries to calculate fairness, performance, stability, explainability, and monitoring metrics.

• Build scripts and dashboards to track AI system behavior, changes in data distribution, drift alerts, and compliance signals.

• Assist in model review cycles, contributing to documentation, risk assessments, model explainability analyses, evidence packages, and compliance artifacts.

• Support the development of standardized RAI operating procedures, templates, and evidence repositories.

• Collaborate with Data Scientists, AI Engineers, Compliance teams, Technology partners, Cloud teams, and Business stakeholders to ensure alignment with enterprise guidelines.

• Participate in incident response simulations, model reliability review sessions, and quality assurance activities.

• Support continuous improvement initiatives to strengthen governance processes, automation, and reporting maturity.

Qualifications
• Currently enrolled in Computer Science, Data Science, Software Engineering, Statistics, AI/ML, or a related field and returning to studies after the work term.

• Foundational understanding of machine learning, statistical analysis, and data pipelines.

• Interest in ethics, governance, fairness, and responsible use of AI systems.

• Experience using Python for analysis, data manipulation, model evaluation, and metrics computation.

• Ability to interpret technical AI concepts and communicate clearly to nontechnical audiences.

• Strong analytical thinking, writing clarity, and attention to detail.

• Familiarity with Jupyter, Git/GitHub, cloud tooling, or ML frameworks is an asset.

What You Will Gain
• Hands-on experience with enterprise-level Responsible AI governance and risk-management workflows.

• Exposure to cross-functional teams and the lifecycle of AI model development, deployment, and monitoring in financial systems.

• Practice applying fairness metrics, explainability tools, and monitoring frameworks.

• Experience contributing to real governance artifacts used by regulators and internal auditors.

• Professional development, mentorship, and networking opportunities through BMO’s campus program, communities of practice, and student learning initiatives.
