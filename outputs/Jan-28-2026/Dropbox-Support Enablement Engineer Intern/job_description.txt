Role Description
As a Support Enablement Engineer Intern, you will play a critical role in executing and implementing AI-driven enablement initiatives that transform how Dropbox delivers customer support at scale. Embedded within the Customer Experience (CX) organization, you will help operationalize AI capabilities, automate support workflows, and strengthen the systems that empower our global support teams.

This is a highly hands-on, execution-focused role where you will contribute directly to real-world AI enablement projects. Your work will streamline support operations, improve agent efficiency, and elevate customer outcomes. By collaborating closely with cross-functional technology partners across Dropbox, you will help translate emerging AI capabilities into practical, scalable solutions that meaningfully enhance the customer support experience.

In our Virtual First work culture, you’ll connect with with Dropboxers virtually and in-person to build the foundation of a strong professional network. As a Summer intern, you will also have the opportunity to attend our Emerging Talent Summit, where participants from our intern and early-career programs come together in person to build lasting relationships, explore learning and development opportunities, and prepare for their career journey ahead.

For Summer 2026, we offer two start dates culminating in a 12-week internship:

May 26 - August 14, 2026
June 30 - Sep 18, 2026
