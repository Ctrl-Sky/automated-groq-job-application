Position Title:	(MSIP) Full Stack Developer Intern
Position Description:	
In a world where companies are quickly building AI tools that will replace human jobs, our mission is to instead empower music creators with AI. At Staccato, we've built an AI co-writer for music producers, enabling them to unlock a constant state of creative flow. Our flagship product, the AI Instrument, helps artists create, extend, and rewrite music using simple text prompts. It listens to your music, understands musical context, and offers suggestions to help you move your music forward. What sets Staccato apart is its use of MIDI, the digital language of music used by professionals. Unlike audiobased AI tools, this allows for precise control over individual notes and instrument selection, making it easy to edit, customize, and build on your ideas.

Staccato has been featured in Fast Company, Billboard.com, the Globe & Mail, and MusicAlly and was Hackernoon's 2023 Startup of the Year for London, Ontario. We are the first (and only) venture capital-backed AI music start-up in Canada. Our team is growing, and this is where you come in.



You will help build the internal analytics dashboard that connects our product data to business outcomes. This dashboard will let us understand who our users are, how they use the product, what prompts they enter, and what behaviors correlate with retention and conversion. You will work across our JUCE plugin (C++) and our web/backend stack (TypeScript) to ensure the right data is captured, aggregated, and presented in a clean, actionable way for product and marketing decisions. As a secondary focus, you will also contribute to improving the JUCE plugin as needed through small, well-scoped fixes and enhancements that support a better user experience and more reliable data.

Duties and Responsibilities:

Design and implement a clear event tracking and user attribute schema (privacy-aware and consistent).
Add or improve product instrumentation in our JUCE plugin (C++) to capture meaningful usage events.
Build TypeScript services to process, aggregate, and summarize product events into usable metrics.
Develop a dashboard UI in TypeScript with filters, segmentation, and cohort views (usage, prompts, location, feature adoption).
Create views that connect product activity to business outcomes (activation, retention, conversion signals).
Validate data quality (edge cases, missing events, consistency across versions).
Write lightweight documentation so the dashboard can be extended after the internship.
Collaborate daily with the founders and engineering team through short check-ins and code reviews.
Actively take part in regular code reviews, both receiving feedback and reviewing others' changes to help keep the codebase clean, consistent, and reliable.
