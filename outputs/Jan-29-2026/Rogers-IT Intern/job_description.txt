Short Description
Job Description
Help ship real customer‑facing capabilities in a national telecom—where scale, reliability and performance matter. You’ll work in cross‑functional squads that plan and deliver in three‑week sprints, synchronize through release trains, and use modern engineering practices (CI/CD, trunk‑based dev, test automation, observability) to move work from idea to production.

Build features end‑to‑end. Work on Cloud native solutions, contribute to front‑end web experiences (React/TypeScript), Backend‑for‑Frontend (.NET), Integration Services (TypeScript, Java, Python) that serve our ecommerce, care and self‑serve journeys.
Integrate services. Help design/consume REST and SOAP APIs and service‑oriented integrations that connect with our BSS/OSS platforms; write adapters and mappers that keep systems loosely coupled.
Automate quality. Add unit/integration tests, participate in CI pipelines, and instrument code for metrics/logging to improve reliability and DORA‑aligned performance (lead time, deployment frequency, change failure rate, MTTR).
Work the agile flow. Pick up stories from squad backlogs, attend stand‑ups, sprint reviews, and retros; collaborate via Jira/Confluence and follow our intake/assessment flow from capability → feature → epic → stories.
Ship safely. Support release train ceremonies; help with feature flags and post‑release monitoring.
Learn telecom. Explore how digital channels interface with core BSS/OSS (customer, product, order, network provisioning) and proprietary scripting used in operational workflows.
Depending on the position, your day-to-day will comprise of any of the following activities:

Pair with senior engineers and architects to break down stories and define acceptance criteria.
Develop responsive UI components and accessible flows; consume/shape API contracts.
Contribute to backend for front end (BFF) and service layers (caching, resilience, pagination, auth).
Write automated tests and update pipelines; monitor dashboards/alerts.
Participate in design reviews and sprint ceremonies; demo your work at reviews.
Document decisions in code and in Confluence; open/triage issues in Jira aligned to our portfolio and squad projects.
Qualifications
Currently enrolled in Software Engineering, Computer Engineering, Computer Science or a related program; eligible for a 4‑month co‑op.
Coursework or projects in web development (HTML/CSS/JS/TypeScript) and at least one modern framework (React preferred).
Experience with server‑side development (React), server-side development (.NET, Next.JS, Java) and/or Enterprise Integration Patterns, working REST or SOAP APIs.
Familiarity with continuous integration tools and concepts
Understanding of data structures, algorithms, and HTTP; basic SQL/NoSQL knowledge.
Curiosity about large‑scale systems (telecom, ecommerce) and willingness to learn BSS/OSS concepts.
Exposure to CI/CD (Jira, Bitbucket, Jenkins), containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), and cloud (AWS).
Experience with test automation (React Testing Library, JUnit), observability (Open Telemetry, Kibana/Grafana), or trunk‑based development practices.
Knowledge of OAuth/OIDC, caching (Redis), resilience patterns (circuit breakers, retries).
Experience with OWASP and secure coding practices
