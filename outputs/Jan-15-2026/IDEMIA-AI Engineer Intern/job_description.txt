Responsibilities
Are you curious about how large language models (LLMs) and generative AI actually work? Do you like solving problems with code and learning by building? Join us to help prototype, test, and deploy intelligent systems that reason, generate, and automate.

What you’ll do
Build and iterate on small AI features and tools with guidance (Python).

Help run and evaluate LLMs (open-source models) in controlled environments.

Contribute to simple APIs and scripts that connect models to real workflows.

Clean and organize datasets (PDF/XML/Markdown/JSON) for experiments.

Run experiments and record results; help debug issues and improve reliability.

Learn modern ML dev practices: versioning, containers, metrics, and basic evals.

What you’ll learn & gain
Hands-on exposure to LLMs, from running to evaluating and shipping small features.

Mentorship from engineers building production-adjacent AI pipelines.

A clear, supportive environment that values curiosity and growth.

Real-world projects in public safety, identity, and enterprise automation.

Qualifications
Must-haves (student-friendly)
Currently enrolled in a CS/Engineering (or similar) program.

Comfortable writing Python and using Git.

Basic ML fundamentals (e.g., linear models, neural nets) from courses or projects.

Curiosity, initiative, and willingness to learn unfamiliar tools.

A project (class or personal) that shows you like building things.

Nice-to-haves (bonus only—not required)
Intro experience with PyTorch or Transformers.

Familiarity with containers (Docker) or REST APIs (FastAPI/Flask).

Interest in LLMs and infra (e.g., vLLM, batching, KV cache).

Exposure to cloud or GPUs (Colab/AWS/local rigs).

Prompt engineering, evaluation, or simple fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA).

Messaging/storage basics (RabbitMQ, MinIO) or data pipelines.
