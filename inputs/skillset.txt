Experience
Job_title = Research Assistant
Location = McMaster University, Computing and Software
Date = May 2023 - Aug 2023
Point = Worked with Dr. Stephen Kelly to research evolving adaptable control policies using gymnasium’s pendulum task and Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python (DEAP) to conduct experiments on the partially observable pendulum task using machine learning
Point = My work laid the foundation for other projects now continued by Dr. Stephen Kelly’s MA students (https://creativealgorithms-cd4c88.gitlab.io/team/) 

Job_title = Software Developer/DevOps Intern
Location = Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan
Date = Sept 2024 - Aug 2025
Point = Implemented CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, GitHub, Ansible, and SonarQube to automate deployment and testing processes of different .NET and python applications.
Point = Rearchitected the company's Docker base image system, consolidating multiple redundant images around a single standardized Ubuntu base image, reducing maintenance complexity and improving efficiency.
Point = Co-led a POC for migrating CI/CD workflows from Jenkins to GitHub Actions. Evaluated capabilities and limitation of actions compared to Jenkins, presenting those findings and best practices to senior leadership, influencing the adoption across multiple teams.
Point = Developed a Jenkins pipeline and Python script to automate internal webpage updates via an API POST request, streamlining manual change processes.
Point = Increased logging visibility within Ansible and Jenkins for Flyway database migrations across Snowflake, MSSQL, and Oracle, improving troubleshooting and monitoring.

Personal Projects
Project name = Gym Tracker App
date = Jan 2024
tech = Swift
Point = Developed a workout tracking app in Swift that allows users to create, save, and monitor custom workouts using persistent storage.
Point = Implemented Core Data for local persistence, utilizing a persistent controller to manage user input and store structured workout data.
Point = Designed fetch requests with filtering logic to retrieve and display relevant data efficiently based on user-defined criteria.

Project name = Expense Sheet Combiner
date = Dec 2024
tech = Python, Bash
Point = Built a Python automation tool to combine and standardize transaction data from my various bank and credit card statements.
Point = Used Pandas and NumPy to clean, reformat, and organize expenses by month and date into a single master Excel sheet.

Project Name = Gemini-Job-App-Generator
date = Feb 2025
tech = Gemini, Python, Bash, GitHub actions	                
Point = Developed a Python application that integrates Google’s Gemini 2.0 model to optimize resumes based on job descriptions.
Point = Automatically generated tailored cover letter templates from the optimized resume results, and organized all outputs into structured directories, replicating an artifact
Point = Designed and implemented a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the end-to-end process for scalability and ease of use

Project Name = automatic-photo-transfer
date = August 2025
tech = Python, Bash, YAML
Point = Developed a CLI-driven Python application that automates photo transfers, transferring photos from a folder to a hard drive, organizing photos into date-based folders, and handling edge cases (live-photos, unsupported filetypes).
Point = Implemented robust EXIF and OS-fallback logic to extract accurate capture timestamps, and added heuristics (e.g., skip <3s MOV live clips) to avoid incorrect migrations
Point = Designed idempotent migration tracking using CSV tables (per-device), so subsequent runs only transfer photos taken after the last recorded timestamp; included timezone verification to prevent data drift.
