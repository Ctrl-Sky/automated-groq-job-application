About the job
This role will be required to work from our downtown Toronto office 2 days a week.

With millions of diners, 60,000+ restaurant partners and 25+ years of experience, OpenTable, part of Booking Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: BKNG), is an industry leader with a passion for helping restaurants thrive. Our world-class technology empowers restaurants to focus on what matters most – their team, their guests, and their bottom line – while enabling diners to discover and book the perfect restaurant for every occasion.

Every employee at OpenTable has a tangible impact on what we do and how we do it. You’ll also be part of a global team and its portfolio of metasearch brands. Hospitality is all about taking care of others, and it defines our culture.

This is a hands-on, build-first internship focused on creating AI agents and workflow automations that handle various complex tasks across departments.

You’ll work within a mature AI platform using existing frameworks, tools, and guardrails to build agents that don't just "chat," but execute multi-step tasks like automated triage, document extraction, and data enrichment. Your job is to implement, test, and improve agents and automations under guidance from senior engineers.

This is a production-grade role. You will write code that manages real data, with a focus on reliability, anti-hallucination guardrails, and long-running workflows.

This is a 12 week internship program.

In This Role, You Will

Stateful Agent Orchestration: Build agents using established frameworks like LangChain and LangGraph to manage complex, multi-step workflows with failure recovery and state management.
Enterprise Integrations: Connect agents to professional toolsets (CRM, Issue Trackers, and Communication platforms) via APIs, OAuth2, and webhooks.
Advanced RAG & Search: Implement and tune retrieval systems using vector databases (qdrant, pgvector) for high-accuracy similarity search and duplicate detection.
Computer Vision: Use Vision-based LLMs to extract structured data from unstructured documents.
Workflow Automation: Implement workflow automations using approved tools (n8n, Zapier, internal platforms).
Observability: Instrument agents with tools like LangSmith for tracing, performance benchmarking, and cost tracking

What You’ll Learn (For Real)

How production AI agents differ from demos
How to design prompts, tools, and flows that don’t collapse under edge cases
How to design anti-hallucination guardrails so agents stay on track during long-running tasks
How to automate business workflows end to end, not just single tasks
How to write code that meets the rigor of a global engineering organization prioritizing readability and long-term maintenance
How security, access control, and governance shape AI systems in practice

What Success Looks Like

You ship working automations that others rely on
Your agents fail less over time because you learn how to harden them
Your code is readable, tested, and easy to extend
You need less hand-holding by the end of the internship

Required Skills

Experience with Python or TypeScript through coursework, projects, or internships
Basic understanding of LLM concepts (prompting, context windows, tool calling)
Hands-on use of GenAI tools (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
Comfort working with APIs, JSON, and webhooks
Willingness to follow existing frameworks instead of reinventing them
Familiarity with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures and how context is retrieved, grounded, and passed to LLMs
